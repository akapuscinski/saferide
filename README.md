# SafeRide
Android app that is part of master's thesis project aimed to detect road potholes. See [project website](http://saferiderhc-akapa.rhcloud.com/)

The app uses smarthpone's accelerometer to detect pothole and gps to localize it, pothole is detected when predefined acceleration threshold values are exceeded. App allows to browse gathered pothole data and displays it as single markers if map visible region is small enough or as circles which covers piece of map.
